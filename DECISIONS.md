This document tracks important architectural and technical decisions made during the project development.

## 📋 **Decision Record Format**

Each decision follows this format:
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: What problem we were solving
- **Decision**: What we decided
- **Rationale**: Why we made this choice
- **Alternatives**: What we considered but didn't choose
- **Consequences**: What this decision means for the project

## 🧰 Environment & Tooling Constraints
**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Context**: CI/dev container restricts system installs; PEP 668 blocks pip writes.
**Decision**: Document venv-first setup; provide restricted-env fallbacks and scriptable test entrypoints; remove unnecessary `asyncio` dependency; add `pyproject.toml` for tooling.
**Consequences**: Reliable local setup; tests/examples runnable without admin; standardized formatting.

---

## 🧪 Continuous Integration Setup
**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Context**: Need automated quality gates for PRs and main.  
**Decision**: Add GitHub Actions CI with Python 3.11/3.12 matrix: install split requirements, run black/isort/flake8, run pytest, and upload `pip freeze` as lock artifact (`requirements/lock-py311.txt`).  
**Alternatives**: Single-version CI (less coverage), local-only checks (no automation).  
**Consequences**: Early breakage detection; consistent code quality; artifact available for pinning.

---

## 📦 Requirements Extras Split
**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Context**: Heavy deps (vision/models) not always needed; dev tools separate.  
**Decision**: Split into `requirements/base.txt`, `requirements/models.txt`, `requirements/vision.txt`, `requirements/dev.txt`; aggregate via root `requirements.txt`.  
**Alternatives**: Single monolithic file (slower installs), optional extras via setup.py (out of scope).  
**Consequences**: Faster, targeted installs; simpler CI steps; clearer dependency boundaries.

---

## 🔒 Version Pinning Policy
**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Context**: Ensure reproducible builds after CI green.  
**Decision**: After CI is green on main, promote the `requirements/lock-py311.txt` artifact to a tracked lock file (e.g., `requirements/locked.txt`) and/or update split files with pinned versions. Trigger via manual step/PR.  
**Alternatives**: Always pin (less flexibility), never pin (non-reproducible).  
**Consequences**: Stable builds; controlled updates; clear workflow for dependency changes.

**Alternatives**: No formal tracking (lose context), Wiki approach (less structured).  
**Consequences**: ✅ Clear history, ✅ Better onboarding, ✅ Professional practices. ⚠️ Requires discipline, ⚠️ Documentation overhead.

---

## 🤖 **Agent Flow Implementation**

**Date**: 2025-08-07 20:10  
**Context**: Need to implement end-to-end agent communication flow with three agent types (Observing, Core, Commands).  
**Decision**: **Implemented complete agent flow** with message passing, AI model integration, and comprehensive testing.  
**Alternatives**: Synchronous processing (no async), direct function calls (no message passing), single agent (no separation).  
**Consequences**: ✅ Full agent communication working, ✅ AI model integration successful, ✅ All tests passing. ✅ Ready for game integration.

---

## 🖼️ **Image Observer Agent Implementation**

**Date**: 2025-08-07 21:30  
**Context**: Need observer agent that takes PNG images and returns text summaries for core agent analysis.  
**Decision**: **Implemented ImageObserverAgent** with vision model factory, comprehensive testing, and multiple input formats (base64, bytes, file path).  
**Alternatives**: Complex computer vision pipeline (overkill), direct API calls (no abstraction), single model provider (less flexible).  
**Consequences**: ✅ Simple image-to-text conversion, ✅ Multiple AI providers supported, ✅ 17/17 tests passing, ✅ Ready for integration.

## 💾 **Save File Integration Strategy**

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Context**: Need to decide how to integrate ONI save file data and manage real-time vs batch processing.  
**Decision**: **Hybrid pause-save-analyze approach** with specialized observer agents for different save file sections.  
**Alternatives**: Real-time integration (too complex), pure automation (less control), manual analysis (not scalable).  
**Consequences**: ✅ Manageable complexity, ✅ Human oversight, ✅ Incremental automation. ⚠️ Requires save file parsers, ⚠️ Manual intervention needed.

---

## 🔍 **Observer Agent Specialization**

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Context**: Need to define how observer agents will analyze different aspects of ONI save files and images.  
**Decision**: **Dedicated specialized observers** - each agent covers specific save file sections plus image-based base analysis.  
**Alternatives**: Single observer (too complex), manual analysis (not scalable), generic observers (less detailed).  
**Consequences**: ✅ Focused expertise, ✅ Detailed analysis, ✅ Modular system. ⚠️ More agents to manage, ⚠️ Need coordination.

---

## 💰 **AI Model Cost Strategy**

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Context**: Need to balance AI model capabilities with cost considerations for different system components.  
**Decision**: **Tiered model approach** - GPT-4 for specialized summaries, GPT-5 for image-to-text, cost-effective models for core decisions.  
**Alternatives**: Single premium model (expensive), all cheap models (less capable), no AI (defeats purpose).  
**Consequences**: ✅ Optimized costs, ✅ Right tool for job, ✅ Scalable approach. ⚠️ Multiple API management, ⚠️ Cost monitoring needed.

## 🧩 Save Parser Roadmap (Phase 1)
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Gaps vs research parsers (JS 7.17, .NET 7.11).  
**Decision**: Implement compression/section framing, type templates, game object/component parsing; keep world/sim preserved; add writer.  
**Consequences**: Real section data for agents; round-trip tests; enables accurate analyses.

## 🔢 Version Support Policy
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Real saves report minor 36; previous range capped at 17 causing warnings.  
**Decision**: Update supported minor range to 36; continue warning only when outside 11–36.  
**Consequences**: No false warnings on current game; expectations aligned with latest version.

## 📦 Data Extraction Contract
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Sections return placeholders (resources/duplicants/threats).  
**Decision**: Define exact keys and fill from parsed components (food, oxygen, power, skills, stress, diseases).  
**Consequences**: Stable API for agents; facilitates incremental parsing.

## 🧵 Parsing Architecture Choice
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: JS uses instruction-based trampoline with progress.  
**Decision**: Adopt incremental parsing with progress hooks; optional coroutine-style iterator later.  
**Consequences**: Better UX, cancellation, and testability; non-breaking to start.

## 🌍 World/Sim Handling Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: World/sim complex; both repos largely preserve.  
**Decision**: Preserve as-is; parse framing/metadata and sizes; expose sizes/checksums.  
**Consequences**: Safe handling now; room to deepen later without blocking.

## 👥 Duplicant Data Parsing Roadmap (Phase 1.1)
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Positions and basic identity extracted; need richer info.  
**Decision**: Implement minimal template reads for MinionIdentity/MinionResume/MinionModifiers to get name, job/role, skills, vitals.  
**Consequences**: Accurate names, jobs, skills, and vitals; removes heuristics.

---

## ❤️ Vitals Extraction Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Current vitals are heuristic scans.  
**Decision**: Parse AmountInstance values (calories/health/stress/stamina) via template subset; fall back omitted.  
**Consequences**: Reliable vitals; consistent units; ready for observer agents.

---

## 🧠 Skills and Roles Plan
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Need skills/aptitudes and current role for agents/UI.  
**Decision**: Read MinionResume (MasteryByRoleID, AptitudeBySkillGroup, currentRole); expose in entities.  
**Consequences**: Actionable crew insights; supports recommendations.

---

## 🏷️ Name Resolution Policy
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Name heuristics can mislabel.  
**Decision**: Prefer concrete `name` in MinionIdentity; avoid `nameStringKey`; drop heuristics once templates land.  
**Consequences**: Stable, correct duplicant names.

---

## 📜 Observer Sections Roadmap Adopted
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Decision**: Adopt per-section observer roadmap and stable v0.1 data contracts.  
**Rationale**: Enables parallel parsing and agent workstreams.  
**Consequences**: Teams can implement independently; core agent receives richer, consistent inputs.  

## 👔 AI PM + Worker Model (Save Parser Focus)
**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Decision**: Use concise worker briefs (prompts) to run parallel tasks confined to save-file parsing; track outcomes here.  
**Consequences**: Faster parallel progress, clear acceptance criteria, and consistent adherence to repo guidelines.
