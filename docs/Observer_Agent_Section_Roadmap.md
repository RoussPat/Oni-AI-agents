# Observer Agents: Save Sections Roadmap

This roadmap defines, for each ONI save-file section, the expected data sources, the observing agentâ€™s goal, and parallelizable tasks. It is aligned with our `SaveGame` structure (header, templates, world, settings, sim_data, game_objects, game_data) and current/planned agents.

## How to use this roadmap
- Parser tasks: low-level parsing work inside `src/oni_ai_agents/services/oni_save_parser/`
- Extraction tasks: populate stable JSON contracts via `SaveFileDataExtractor`
- Agent tasks: prompts/heuristics and outputs for observer agents
- Tests: unit/integration tests with real saves
